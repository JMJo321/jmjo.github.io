                  I examine what information households respond to in their monthly energy bills. Previous work has uncovered evidence that households largely respond to the average price they pay for energy in the previous billing period. In cases where utilities are charging tiered rates—i.e., a low price on a small amount of electricity and a higher price on consumption beyond that baseline level—these average prices will differ from the marginal price (i.e., the price paid for the last unit of electricity consumed). In this paper, I re-examine whether households indeed pay attention solely to the average price. Using detailed hourly consumption data from over 100,000 households in Sacramento, California, I measure the impact of surpassing the first threshold of nonlinear tariff structures in a billing month on households' average daily electricity consumption in subsequent months. My empirical results illustrate that households consumed enough to be subjected to a higher marginal price in the previous billing period reduced their electricity consumption in the succeeding billing month. This finding illustrates one of the many inefficiencies that arise from tiered rate structures: households' response to prices that are not reflecting current supply conditions but rather the household's past consumption levels.

                  I examine how households respond to Time-Of-Use (TOU) electricity prices that vary throughout the course of the day. The primary purpose of the time-varying pricing scheme is to reshape households' electricity consumption in and near peak-demand hours---more specifically, to reduce their consumption during peak hours and shift some of their consumption to off-peak hours. The existing literature presents evidence that under TOU tariff structures, residential consumers reduced their electricity consumption during peak price periods, but these reductions were insensitive to the marginal changes in peak-hour prices. In other words, the study finds that the law of demand did not appear to hold in terms of household electricity consumption under TOU prices, which could undermine the benefits achieved using TOU or any other pricing strategy. In this paper, I re-examine the impact of TOU rates but with a different strategy. Rather than estimating how aggregate consumption responds to TOU rates, I decompose household electricity consumption into two distinct categories: consumption for non-temperature-control and temperature-control uses. My empirical analysis shows that households indeed responded to the magnitude of the price increase in the peak rate period; however, the response was not the same for temperature-control and non-temperature control uses. In particular, while non-temperature-control-driven consumption during the peak hours markedly fell as the peak price increased, temperature-control-driven consumption fell prior to the peak hours, and actually increased during the peak hours, relative to the reduction in pre-peak hours, as the peak price increased. Ultimately, the differences in the responses across these two channels masked households' high price sensitivity. Moreover, it also illustrates that the two types of electricity consumption evolved differently, and nonlinearly, according to daily heating degree days and the point electricity was consumed in time. The multifaceted dynamics of residential electricity consumption under TOU pricing imply that an autonomous heating control system is necessary to maximize the benefits of TOU electricity pricing.

                  Two technological advances, hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, enable the US shale revolution: the dramatic growth of oil and gas production from horizontal wells. For investors and policymakers, it is vital to understand how the number of wells drilled, indicating fracking firms' drilling decisions, evolves according to oil prices and costs because drilling activity drives oil production. Furthermore, due to the spatial variability of resource quality, per-well productivity is also an important piece of information for projecting short-run oil and gas production. In a recent paper, Hotelling's classic model of nonrenewable resource extraction is recast as a drilling problem to explain observations in Texas that drilling activity responds to oil prices sensitively, while oil production from existing wells does not respond. The phenomenon observed in North Dakota, simultaneous drilling of horizontal wells with different qualities, however, cannot be rationalized in the reformulated dynamic model, which predicts, as usual, least-cost-first drillings. In this paper, we construct a continuous time dynamic discrete choice model by formulating fracking firms' drilling decisions as an optimal stopping problem. Our model can be estimated empirically using microeconomic data and also solved analytically for an aggregate solution. In addition, our model has an advantage in providing production projections reflecting the spatial heterogeneity in resource quality. Interestingly, our model converges to the class Hotelling model when well-level shocks have no randomness.
